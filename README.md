# Simulation Federated Learning on Human Activity Recognition with CNN 

Federated Learning (FL) allows machine learning algorithms to gain insights into a broad range of datasets located at different locations, enabling a privacy-preserving model development [1]. It was announced in 2016 by Google [2]. Clients contribute locally-trained models, the data never leaning their device!

In this simulation, we will be performing Federated Learning with a dataset of human activity with CNN.

## Installation

First, upload the data in the folder data. Then you can run the notebook Federated Learning Simulation.ipynb
